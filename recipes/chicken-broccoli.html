      <em>
        Chicken and Broccoli Stir Fry satisfies the craving for takeout and
        you'll feel good about serving this to your family because it's
        healthier than going out. If you loved our Beef and Broccoli, then you

        mushrooms and fresh broccoli.
      </em>
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Chicken</strong> – we used boneless skinless chicken breast, but
        chicken tenders or even thighs would be delicious here.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stir Fry Veggies</strong> – We love the combination of broccoli,
        onions, and mushrooms for an authentic Chicken Broccoli Stir fry. You
        could sub the broccoli with snap peas or zucchini and sub onions with
        julienned carrots.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chicken Broth </strong> – this adds more flavor, but water can
        easily be substituted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Low Sodium Soy Sauce</strong> – Since different brands have
        different amounts of salt, add soy sauce to taste. You can always add
        more at the end, but you can’t take salt out of a dish. For gluten-free,
        use Tamari sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sesame Oil </strong>– this one ingredient gives the sauce
        authentic Chinese stir fry flavor. Do not skip it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ginger & Garlic</strong> – fresh is best for stir fry, but in a
        pinch, you can substitute 1 tsp fresh garlic for 1/2 tsp garlic powder
        and substitute 1 tsp fresh ginger for 1/8-1/4 tsp ground ginger.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Brown Sugar</strong>– we used 2 Tablespoons of packed light
        brown sugar. You can substitute with 1 1/2 Tbsp to 2 Tbsp of liquid
        sweetener like honey, or add it to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Corn Starch</strong> – using cornstarch as a thickener helps
        keep this gluten-free.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Make the Sauce: Combine all of the sauce ingredients and stir to dissolve
      the sugar. The warm broth will help the sugar to dissolve easily.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cook Chicken: Cut chicken into small 3/4″ bite-sized pieces and season
      lightly with black pepper. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high
      heat with 1 Tbsp oil. Add chicken and cook 1 minute undisturbed then stir
      fry 5 minutes until golden and just cooked through. Remove chicken to a
      bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sautee Veggies: In the same skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 Tbsp oil,
      broccoli florets, sliced onion and mushrooms and stir fry 3 minutes until
      mushrooms are softened then reduce heat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add Stir Fry Sauce: Give the sauce a quick stir in case there was settling
      and add it to the skillet. Simmer the sauce over medium/low heat for 3-4
      minutes until thickened and garlic and ginger have mellowed in flavor. To
      thin the sauce, add water as needed and you can add more soy sauce to
      taste.
    </li>
    <li>
      return Chicken to the Pan and stir until heated through then serve over
      white rice garnished with sesame seeds if desired.
